# CS-241-BYU-I
This is  what I've learned on CS 241 studying at Bringham Young University -Idaho. The main focus of the course was learning OOP and Data Structures in Python language. Also, we learned a little bit of some  main data analyzis python libraries. This course was part of the Computer Programming Certificate, wich is part of Applied Technology Bachelor's Degree. I won't develop this README because this repository was just to record/save my lines of code, it was not developed any great project related to Python.
